```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

For this assignment, we are looking at and evaluating the function called "myMean". This function takes the sum of a vector of numbers and divides it by the numeric length of another vector.

```{r}
assignment <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
lengthVector = c(1:12)
myMean <- function(myMean) {
  return(sum(assignment)/length(lengthVector))
}
round(myMean(), digits = 2)
```

In the example above, the sum of our 'assignment' vector totals to `r sum(assignment)` and the length of the divisor in this case is `r length(lengthVector)`. We can now call the function to find that the mean of our assignment vector is `r round(myMean(), digits = 2)`.
